# Convolution Visualizer

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catab60/ConvolutionVisualizer/refs/heads/main/Preview.gif)

This project helps visualize how convolution parameters affect the relationship between input, weight, and output matrices using Python and Tkinter. You can interact with sliders to adjust the parameters and see how they influence the matrices and the resulting output.

## Future Improvements:
- Adding Dilation
- Adding Stride

I developed this app as a tool to deepen my understanding of convolution and to enhance my AI knowledge, helping with my journey into artificial intelligence.

## Installation:
1. Install Tkinter by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

2. Run the app by executing `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
