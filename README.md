# Convolution Visualizer

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catab60/ConvolutionVisualizer/refs/heads/main/Preview.gif">

This project helps visualize how convolution parameters affect the relationship between input, weight, and output matrices using Python and Tkinter. You can interact with sliders to adjust the parameters and see how they influence the matrices and the resulting output.

## Future Improvements:
- Adding Dilation
- Adding Stride

I developed this app as a tool to deepen my understanding of convolution and to enhance my AI knowledge, helping me prepare for my journey into artificial intelligence.
